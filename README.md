Federated learning, a decentralized
model training paradigm, is implemented using the
Flower framework in this research. The study
focuses on predicting heart disease collaboratively
across multiple clients while preserving data
privacy. A custom neural network model is trained
on clients, and the federated learning strategy of
Flower facilitates model updates aggregation. The
experiments showcase the effectiveness of
collaborative model training, emphasizing data
privacy preservation and reduced communication
overhead. The results contribute to the growing
field of federated learning applications and
highlight the unique features of the Flower
framework.
